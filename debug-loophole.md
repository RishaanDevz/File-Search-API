The loophole executable may have to be moved into your system's PATH. Follow the steps below to diagnose.


1. Make the loophole file executable:
```bash
chmod +x loophole
```

2. Move the loophole executable to a directory in your PATH (choose one):
```bash
sudo mv loophole /usr/local/bin/
# or
sudo mv loophole /usr/bin/
```

You should then be able to run `loophole account login` to proceed with the sign in.
